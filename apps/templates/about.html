        <strong class="text-danger">Every drop of blood carries a story of hope.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Every day, someone somewhere is fighting for their life — a mother rushing her child to the hospital, 
        a son trying to save his father, a stranger silently praying in a waiting room. In those desperate moments, 
        nothing matters more than <strong>time</strong>… and <strong>blood</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Blood-Line was born from one powerful belief:  
        <strong>humanity becomes stronger when we stand for each other.</strong>  
        This platform is not built by an organization, but by people — ordinary people with extraordinary compassion —  
        who understand that one donation can rewrite a family’s future.
    </p>

    <div class="p-3 my-4 rounded shadow-sm bg-light border-start border-danger border-4">
        <p class="mb-0">
            Here, donors are not just names on a list.  
            They are lifesavers.  
            They are hope-givers.  
            They are the silent heroes who choose kindness without expecting anything in return.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Blood-Line exists to bring these heroes closer to those who need them.  
        When families are running from hospital to hospital, when the world feels like it’s falling apart,  
        this community becomes a bridge of support — fast, reliable, and human.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether you want to register as a donor or post a blood requirement,  
        Blood-Line is here to make it simple, quick, and life-changing.
